[**GoWind**](https://github.com/j-delisle/gowind) is an extremely simple boilerplate that I use to get a Hugo site up and running using Tailwind CSS.

## Includes

This boilerplate includes all that is needed at a minimum to get a Hugo site up and running with Tailwindcss - this includes the tailwind css dependecies of:
- PostCSS
- PostCSS-import
- PostCSS-CLI
- PurgeCSS
- autoprefixer

## How to Use

```
1. Git clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` from root directory
3. Start to build and customize your site!
```

This uses `Hugo Server` for local development and uses Hugo Pipes to build and minimize the css
